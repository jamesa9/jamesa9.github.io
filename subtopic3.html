      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big>This article gives insight on how social media is being used as a form of technology in psychological research studies. It provides information on what psychologist’s plans are for using social media platforms to spread awareness about mental health. It, also, explains why they are trying to diminish the depiction of what a typical psychologist looks and act like. They want the public to know more about mental disorders and how they can be overlooked because they are undetectable. They believe this is a great way to get the generation’s attention on how to access resources and learn methods that can help with managing with their conditions.<br>
